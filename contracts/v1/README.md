# v1 Fixture Mirror

This folder contains a publish-safe mirror of `v1` request/response fixtures used by SDK and compatibility tests.

These files are **not** the canonical source of truth. Canonical fixtures and golden tests remain in the private backend repository.

TODO: sync from backend canonical fixtures for final field-level parity before a production release.
